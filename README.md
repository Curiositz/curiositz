<h3>Hi! 👋 I'm Marijana.</h3> 

<p>I have a strong interest in full-stack development, with a particular focus on frontend technologies. I am truly inspired by the process of taking an idea and bringing it to life through coding. It is highly satisfying to create something that has real-world use and provides solutions to problems. </p>

<p>I'm drawn to optimized web applications that are based on simple (and creative) solutions. Those solutions deliver an idea exceptionally well while allowing everyone access to content and functionality without bloated code and complicated systems. To me, this is an art form. As the famous quote goes, <br><br>
  <blockquote>The best design is the simplest one that works.</blockquote>
</p>
